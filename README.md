# Description
The To-Do List Project is a fully functioning to do list. A user is able to submit to dos which are listed and counted by the app. Users can cross out to dos and have the option of either deleting completed to dos or all listed items. 

## How its Made
This project involved the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


## What I Learned
This project challenged me to break down a project with theuser in mind. The To-do list app had many steps and analyzing what the user would need to complete each task using the app helped me to figure out what i needed to be coding.
